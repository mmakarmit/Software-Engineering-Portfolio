# Setup: Visual Studio and GitHub

## Introduction

The contents of this section of my personal repository are to satisfy the requirements for the first active
week of portfolio work. This week is focusing on the setup of all of the software required to move forward with
the group project. As the groups are relatively large and most members of the group are coming from completely
different backgrounds, this is more difficult than it may seem. Some members of the group, myself included, do
not have the expected skills due to the direct access path that was taken to get to this point on the course
from another organisation. I have not previously completed the methods module, used GitHub, linked my Visual
Studio to another entity, or cloned repositories. Due to the mixed skill base in the group it is expected that
a buddy system be implemented to marry up members of the team with people who possess the skills the other may
lack.

## Prerequisites

* I ensured Visual Studio was installed on my laptop, taking care to use the latest version 2022 as that is what the university is using.
* I created a GitHub account as this was something I had never used before.
* Make best efforts to use my own laptop at all times.

## 1.0 Creating a Shared GitHub Team Repository 

### 1.1 Designating a Repository Creator

Our team had to hold a meeting right away and communicate to each other what our experience and skillsets
consisted of as most of us were new to each other. In this meeting we hashed out what parts of the
setup people needed help with due to inexperience and buddied them up with a person or persons
to rectify this. We also implemented a team discord server to make communication easier moving forward.
Next on the agenda was to identify who would create the shared team repository.
This was left to the two most experienced team members who had previously completed the 
prerequisities to achieve this, including the methods module in the previous year.

# Setup

This section documents your practical work in week 2.

The main requirements are to show that:

1. Your development environment is correctly set up
2. You understand the setup including potential alternative configuration settings

## Environment configuration

Here, you should include appropriate screenshots with additional commentary. 

**DO**

* Place your image files in the `images` folder
* Choose your screenshots carefully so that they communicate the appropriate information.
  Many screenshots with no clear purpose or with trivial differences are of little value.
* Provide <ins>descriptive</ins> commentary to explain why the screenshot is included. 
  what it shows and point out any particularly significant details.
* Modify your screenshots - for example, by adding arrows, outlines or other highlighting 
  techniques - to enhance their communication value.
* Remove unnecessary material from your screenshots such as toolbars, other windows and 
  computer desktop to eliminate distractions.
* Ensure that any important content is clearly legible. Pay particular attention to text
  size and image resolution.
* Use [numbered captions](https://towardsdev.com/3-ways-to-add-a-caption-to-an-image-using-markdown-f2ca30562be6) 
  as labels for images. Also, use the caption numbers to refer to images in your text.

**DON'T**

* Expect the reader to understand your reasons for including a screenshot. If you can't
  explain it, the screenshot will not do the job on its own.
* Include self-evident comments. For example, don't simply list the values used on a
  configuration page if those values are clearly visible in the screenshot.

## Reflection

For this section, decide what points are worth making and structure your content 
appropriately.

**DO**

* Use sub-headings to differentiate between sections
* Provide <ins>reflective</ins> commentary that discusses, for example, limitations of
  your current configuration, how your configuration is appropriate for the current 
  project, alternative configuration that might be appropriate in ther circumstances, 
  etc.
* Mention any difficulties you had setting up your working environment and how you 
  resolved them

**DON'T**

* Repeat the descriptive commentary from point 1
* Give a blow-by-blow account of everything you did. Instead, you should highlight 
  the important points.
